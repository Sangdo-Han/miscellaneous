## **geeks**
Collection of pure personal projects.   

1. **layer-flow**  
Main purpose of this project is to find out how the deep learning networks actually work with visualization. It will support two main-stream dl frameworks: tensorflow2 and pytorch.

2. **WGMM**  
*WGMM*(Who's Got My Money) is a project to find out who's got my money in stock market.


## **computer-vision**
Collection of my learnings about Computer Vision (Image Classification, Object Detection, Sementic Segmentation, Image Captioning, etc)

1. Tensorflow or python implementations on SOTA algorithms
2. Implementation of Fundamental Algorithms (Handcraft, simple CNN, etc)

## **time-series**
Collection of my learnings about Signal Processing Tasks (Sound Classification, Sound Denoising, Sound/signal Anomaly Detection, etc)

1. Preprocessing Algorithms
2. Tensorflow or python implementations on SOTA algorithms
